# Django Recipe App

## Setting Up the App

### 1. Create a New App
To create a new Django app named `vege`:
```bash
python manage.py startapp vege
```

### 2. Define Models
After defining or modifying models in `models.py`:
1. Generate the migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
2. Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` under the `EXTERNAL_APP` section:
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        'vege',
    ]
    ```
3. Apply the migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### 3. Add Views and Templates
- Add views in `views.py` to handle logic for your app.
- Create a `templates` folder inside your app directory and add relevant HTML files.

### 4. Configure URLs
- Add the app's URLs to your `core/urls.py` file:
    ```python
    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns = [
        ...,
        path('vege/', include('vege.urls')),
    ]
    ```

## Shell Commands for Managing Recipes

### 1. Start the Django Shell
To open the Django shell:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### 2. Import the Model
Inside the shell, import the `Receipe` model:
```python
from vege.models import Receipe
```

### 3. Add a Recipe
#### Using `create` Method:
```python
Receipe.objects.create(
    receipe_name="Pancake",
    receipe_description="A fluffy pancake recipe.",
    receipe_image="path/to/image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid file path
)
```

#### Using `save` Method:
```python
recipe = Receipe(
    receipe_name="Waffles",
    receipe_description="Crispy waffles with syrup.",
    receipe_image="path/to/waffles.jpg"
)
recipe.save()
```

### 4. List All Recipes
To view all recipes:
```python
recipes = Receipe.objects.all()
for recipe in recipes:
    print(f"Name: {recipe.receipe_name}, Description: {recipe.receipe_description}")
```

### 5. Retrieve a Specific Recipe
Fetch a recipe by its name:
```python
recipe = Receipe.objects.get(receipe_name="Pancake")
print(recipe.receipe_description)
```

### 6. Update a Recipe
Update an existing recipe:
```python
recipe = Receipe.objects.get(receipe_name="Pancake")
recipe.receipe_description = "Updated description for Pancake."
recipe.save()
```

### 7. Delete a Recipe
To delete a specific recipe:
```python
recipe = Receipe.objects.get(receipe_name="Pancake")
recipe.delete()
```

### 8. Delete All Recipes
To delete all recipes:
```python
Receipe.objects.all().delete()
```

### 9. Exit the Shell
To exit the shell:
```bash
exit()
```

## Key Notes
1. **File Handling**: Ensure you provide valid file paths for the `receipe_image` field. Implement file handling logic if required.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions when using `get` to avoid errors if the record doesnâ€™t exist:
    ```python
    from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist

    try:
        recipe = Receipe.objects.get(receipe_name="Nonexistent")
    except ObjectDoesNotExist:
        print("Recipe not found.")
    ```
